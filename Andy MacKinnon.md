A Metchosin councillor since 2014, Mackinnon worked as a botanist in the BC Forest Service for three decades until his retirement in 2015. There, he led the province’s forest ecology program, which focused on old-growth structure and composition, the effects of climate change, and BC’s native plants and fungi. He is an Adjunct Professor at Simon Fraser University, which granted him an Honorary Doctor of Science in 2013. He has also taught rainforest ecology courses in Bamfield for the University of Victoria and in Haida Gwaii for the University of British Columbia. This is his second time as the BC Greens candidate for Esquimalt-Metchosin.
