A three-term MLA now running for re-election, Lana Popham has represented Saanich South since 2009. As Minister of Agriculture, she oversaw the reform of the Agricultural Land Commission and worked on the Grow BC, Feed BC, and Buy BC programs. Raised on Quadra Island, in 1996 she established what would become the first certified organic vineyard on Vancouver Island. Her campaign has said her priorities are affordable housing, new childcare spaces in the region, completing major safety improvements to the Pat Bay Highway and opening a new urgent care centre in the North Quadra neighbourhood.
