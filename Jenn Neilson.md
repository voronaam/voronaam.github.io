Neilson is the founder and artistic director of Alter Arts Society which held its first socially distant Out There Art Festival in Victoria this past August. In 2014, using $20,000 raised on Kickstarter Neilson started Jill and Jack Kids, a clothing company that looks to remove “gender stereotypes” from its products. Last year, Neilson also spearheaded a movement to turn the former Blanshard Elementary School into a community space. Neilson has been critical of John Horgan’s treatment of the Wet’suwet'en first Nation, provincial fossil fuel subsidies and the NDP handling of the overdose crisis.
