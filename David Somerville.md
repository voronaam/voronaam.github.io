David Somerville is a legislative assistant and recent UVic graduate with a BA in history.. Born in Campbell River, Somerville has been living in Victoria since 2015 and is making the case that his experience supporting MLAs has prepared him to represent the riding as one. Somerville has been championing the cause of students and young families who struggle with the cost of living. Touting the Liberal Party plan to end the ICBC monopoly, Somerville recently took to Twitter to write that “young drivers with clean records are paying over $5000 for their insurance - the system is clearly broken.”
