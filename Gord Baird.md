A second-term councillor in the District of Highlands, Baird’s resume is heavy on water protection. He is Vice Chair of the CRD Regional Water Supply Commission and is Commissioner for the Juan de Fuca Water Distribution Commission. He also co-owns Eco-Sense Living, a business that specializes in sustainable building systems including no-flush toilets and grey water re-use. Baird has called this election a “profoundly disturbing pandemic election” and cites one of his concerns as the Mines Act, which he describes as “archaic.”
