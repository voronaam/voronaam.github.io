Alexandra Morton is a biologist and environmental activist who has lived and worked in the North Island villages of Echo Bay and Sointula since the early 1980s. 

As a biologist Morton is known for a 30-year study of orcas in the Broughton Archipelago, which ultimately led her to her activism opposing Pacific Coast fish farms. In 1981, Morton founded Raincoast Research Society which spearheaded some of the first studies on the impact of open pen fish farms on wild salmon stocks. Morton is the author of multiple books, including two childrenâ€™s books and the forthcoming autobiography Not On My Watch. Currently serving on the Department of Fishery and Oceans Indigenous and Multi-stakeholder Advisory Committee on Aquaculture, Morton also served on the Regional District Resource Board for Area A in the 1990s.
