Norm Facey is an engineer and forestry executive who describes himself as “a mill guy from a forestry family.” A resident of Campbell River, he followed his grandfather and father into the forestry business, ultimately working his way up to executive roles at Western Forest Products before finally becoming Senior Vice-President of Timberlands. Facey says the most important challenge BC now faces with the COVID-19 pandemic is getting the economy moving and getting people back to work. Facey is also an avid sailor, having circumnavigated the globe in a sailboat.
