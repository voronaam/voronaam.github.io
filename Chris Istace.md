Chris Istace spent 20 years working senior roles in the oil and gas industry across Alberta and Saskatchewan, and during this time served two terms as a city councillor in Estevan, SK. He says that after a realization in 2013 that his values no longer aligned with the industry he worked in, he and his wife and two children downsized and made the journey half way across the country to settle on Vancouver Island. Istace has served as president of the Chemainus Business Improvement Association for the last three years. He is also a former board member of the Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society. Istace runs The Mindful Explorer, a freelance photography and writing business that works with destination and tourism marketing organizations.
