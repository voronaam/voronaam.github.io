Rob Lyon is a former naval officer and self-described rocket scientist; in the Royal Canadian Navy he programmed missile control systems. Previously a staunch political conservative, Lyon says he has recently undergone a political awakening. A father of 5, volunteer Scout Master and owner of a Passive House, Lyon has developed a deep connection to nature and passion for preserving our environment. The snap election during the COVID-19 pandemic struck Lyon as opportunistic and unfair, prompting him to reach out to the Green Party to volunteer. Lyon most recently worked as a Senior Project Manager for the Government of Canada. He also served on the Esquimalt Emergency Preparedness Committee between 1998 and 2000 and was a 20 year volunteer leader and advisor for the Duke of Edinburgh Award program.
