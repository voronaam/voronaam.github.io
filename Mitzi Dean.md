Mitzi Dean is running for re-election in Esquimalt-Metchosin. Since 2018 she has served as Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. Prior to being an MLA, she was Executive Director of Pacific Centre Family Services, where she led a team that her campaign says helped 1,600 people every year battle the effects of trauma, violence, and mental illness. Before she moved to Victoria in 2005, she was a senior manager with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the U.K.'s largest child protection charity.
