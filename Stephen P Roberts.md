Saltsping Island-resident Stephen P. Roberts was born in Sidney and spent the first half of his career working in accounting, law, and finance, armed with a degree in Economics and Political Science. He was COO of two large international banks and ran their research divisions in Asia. 
Roberts has a particular interest in healthcare and currently chairs the Vancouver Hospice Society and is part chair of the Saltspring Hospice and the Lady Minto Gulf Islands Hospital Foundation. He says the biggest issue the riding is facing, as with many others across the province, is post-pandemic economic recovery. He adds that a strong plan to put people back to work is what the community needs.
