Having turned 18 on October 9, if elected O’Connor could well be the youngest person to take political office in Canadian history. A recent high school graduate, O’Connor worked in the recently successful leadership campaign of Sonia Furstenau. In high school, she co-founded a political review, co-headed the politics club, and co-hosted an all-candidates debate in the 2019 federal election. She has said she is running because a substantial portion of the electorate feel like they are not represented and heard.
